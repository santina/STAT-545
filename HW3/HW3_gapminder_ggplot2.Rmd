(since github doesn't render graphs from R, so I have manually added them in the markdown)

In this R markdown I'm going to try out some ggplot2 features I just learned from Prof. Jenny Bryan's [tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial) on the [gapminder data](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/data/gapminderDataFiveYear.txt) like in the last Rmd assignment. 

First let's see what variables we can play with: 

```{r }
#load ggplot2 and dplyr, which we will used later
library(ggplot2) 
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
#load gapminder data 
gdURL <- "http://tiny.cc/gapminder"
data <- read.delim(file = gdURL) 
str(data)
```

So we have country, continent, pop (population), gdpPercap, lifeExp, and year. That's plenty to work with. Since lifeExp has been explored quite throroughly in the tutorial, I'll focus on other variables. 

Also, there are only 2 countries in Oceania so I will exclude them from further analysis. 

```{r}
data  <- subset(data, continent != "Oceania")
```

#Population Boom
I'm interested to find out the trend of the population growth globally 

So we need to break down the problem step by step.  
- sum population of all countries by year 
- construct a smooth histogram 

##Global Population
Sounds like a daunting task... take a moment to think what'd be a smart way to sum population by continent? 
...
Ans: use the %>% to pipe and filter and summarize! 
```{r}
population_year  <-  data %>% group_by(year) %>% 
    summarize(million = sum(pop)/1000000) 

head(population_year, 10)
```

Now we graph it 
```{r}
ggplot(data=population_year, aes(x=year, y=million)) + 
  geom_histogram(stat="identity", alpha=0.5)

```
![population_year](./image_HW3/population_year.png)

Note that we need to specify `stat = "identity"` because we have pre-tabulated, i.e. the heights (population in millions) are already calculated. 

## Population by Continent 
Let's try adding more information, supposed we want to see how much each continent contributes to the total population... 

```{r}
#create a new data.frame with total population sorted by year and continent
population_continent  <-  data %>% group_by(year, continent) %>% 
  summarize(million = sum(pop)/1000000) 

#make a smooth graph, color by continent
ggplot(data=population_continent, 
  aes(x = year, y = million, color = continent)) + 
  geom_density(stat="identity", alpha=0.6)

```
![population_continent](./image_HW3/population_continent.png)

Looks like Asia contributes to the most... to double check, let's use a bit more R trick 

```{r}
population_continent  %>% 
  filter(continent=="Asia")  %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))

```

Indeed we see that in 2007 the population in Asia was close to 4000 millions. 

#The Wealth of the World 

I'm now curious to see the growth (supposedly) of the total wealth measured by gdpPercap in the world. 


##GDP per capita by year 
Using the same technique with the population, let's first visualize the trend of the wealth and how much each continent contributes to the total wealth. 


```{r}
#create a new data.frame with total population sorted by year and continent
wealth_continent  <-  data %>% 
  group_by(year, continent) %>% 
  summarize(totalGDP = sum(gdpPercap)) 


#make a smooth graph, color by continent
ggplot(data=wealth_continent, 
       aes(x = year, y = totalGDP, color = continent)) + 
  geom_density(stat="identity", alpha=0.6)

```
![wealth_continent](./image_HW3/wealth_continent.png)

We see that Europe has the most combined wealth in the recorded years. 


##Wealth gap by year 

Now I'm curious to see the wealth gap by year... whether it increases, decreases, or fluctuates throughout the recorded years. To do that, we'll draw box graphs with raw data layed on top to see range, median, mean, and all that.  

```{r}
#(in order) create box plot and layer dots of raw data and then customize the title and theme
library(ggthemes) 

ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = year)) +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0), alpha = 1/4) +
  ggtitle("Wealth Gap") + theme_economist()

```

![wealth_gap](./image_HW3/wealth_gap.png)

Sadly the wealth cap is extremely large especially in the 1950 to 1980s. There are some really wealthy countries in the mid 1900 but they seem to disappeared toward 2000. To take a glimpse of what they are: 

```{r}
# to see the richest countries in 1950s (earliest year is 1952)
head(data  %>% select(year, country, gdpPercap) %>% 
       filter(year == 1952)  %>% arrange(desc(gdpPercap)))

# see the richest countries in 2007 
head(data  %>% select(year, country, gdpPercap) %>% 
       filter(year == 2007)  %>% arrange(desc(gdpPercap)))

```

Woah, Kuwait used to be very rich! According to the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait#Economic_prosperity): 
"In 1951, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaitis to enjoy a better standard of living. By 1952, the country became the largest exporter of oil in the Persian Gulf region.......In the 1980s, there were many terror attacks in Kuwait..." 

##a little reflection 
During the graphing process, I had a lot of trouble graphing a dataframe that I created myself. After hours of frustration (and having to go outside for breaks twice) and reading some [stack overflow posts](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15651084/ggplot2-mapping-variable-to-y-and-using-stat-bin), I finally realize that ggplot2 has this strange habit of trying to tabulated your data. So if you have pretabulate it you need to use `stat = "identity"` 

Lastly, it's interesting to see how data can reflect the real life events. By going through the ggplot2 tutorials, I learned a lot today. (ready to beome a better R ninja!)
