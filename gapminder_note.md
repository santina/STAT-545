#Intro

The following consists of some interesting observations obtained from 
[Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/) with their data on [statistical records 
on various countries] (http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/data/gapminderDataFiveYear.txt)

Information on these five countries include categories such as GDP per capital, life expectancy, etc. 

This little write-up will explore some of the built-in R functions and how they can reveal some interesting information in this dataset.
